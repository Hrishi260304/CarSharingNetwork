# CarSharingNetwork

## Project Description

CarSharing Network is a decentralized peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. The platform enables vehicle owners to monetize their idle vehicles while providing convenient and affordable transportation options for renters. The system integrates comprehensive insurance coverage and implements usage-based pricing to ensure fair and transparent transactions.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize urban mobility by creating a decentralized, trustless vehicle sharing ecosystem that:

- **Empowers Vehicle Owners**: Transform idle vehicles into income-generating assets
- **Provides Accessible Transportation**: Offer affordable, on-demand vehicle access without the burden of ownership
- **Ensures Trust & Security**: Leverage blockchain technology to create transparent, secure transactions with built-in insurance protection
- **Promotes Sustainability**: Maximize vehicle utilization to reduce the overall number of cars needed in urban areas
- **Creates Economic Opportunity**: Enable a peer-to-peer economy where individuals can participate as both service providers and consumers

## Core Features

### 1. Vehicle Registration (`register-vehicle`)
- Vehicle owners can list their cars on the platform
- Comprehensive vehicle information including make, model, year, and location
- Flexible pricing with hourly rates set by owners
- Integrated insurance coverage specification
- Automatic availability management

### 2. Smart Booking System (`book-vehicle`)
- Instant vehicle booking with duration-based pricing
- Automatic cost calculation including:
  - Base rental fee (set by vehicle owner)
  - Platform fee (5% of base cost)
